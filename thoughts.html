    <p>The journey for me this semester has been one of new challenges, new skills, new relationships and most of all new gray hairs. Working with my team has been great. These men are very talented and very hard working. They are also my Brothers in the Gospel. I will share my thoughts about this semester and what I've learned and what I'll take away from this experience.</p>
    <p>Learning for me is typically a solo act. Reading texts, taking quizzes and such, typical college work. This course was much more different than any other class I’ve taken so far at BYUI. Instead of being spoon fed content, I had a general direction to follow and I had to make it happen. It was uncomfortable at first, I won’t lie, and when I saw the code topics, my anxiety levels began to rise. With each passing week and as deadlines closed in, I could feel the pressure to perform. I tackled the "easy" stuff first, just to get the ball rolling. Then I would chip away at the harder tasks, making effort to at least contribute something each day.</p>
    <p>In our group, we broke up who would teach what topics based on how we each felt we could teach. I knew that I would struggle with local storage a little and so I wanted that one to try to push myself outside my comfort zone. I knew a little about audio/video and DOM changes through js. I didn’t want to go first week because it was going to take me time to get up to speed on local storage and so it fell on week 7 for me. I felt good about that, I didn’t have immediate pressure to produce which I’ve found is the best way for me to work. Tight timelines and new ideas are hard for me sometimes. I learned a lot from the group immediately. I was leaning on them to learn the things I’d never even thought about. In this respect, I wonder how my degree path hasn’t been able to provide me with what I need skill-wise in order to move to the next level after graduation. Regardless, I find that I was working at the speed of the calendar often times. I would see the due date and work at the speed required to meet the deadline. If something became too hard, it would be harder to work on it because I knew when it was due and it made the task become more like work than fun. Doing work is not always fun and I find that I avoid work when it’s work. The grind for the sake of the grind is not my style.</p>
    <p>Our team was comprised of software engineers by major mostly and I found out that most of them were already working as front end developers or in the field in which they were studying. It was intimidating to come into a group that didn’t seem to need this class other than to be able to check off a box. I would soak up all their information and personal profile website content, all that I could. I would see what they are doing and that would inspire a direction for whatever I was working on. I did realize early on that they were more than willing to mentor me along the way. They could tell I was a little hesitant to offer opinions in our group meetings each week and it was because I was trying to learn. I worked hard to be confident and to participate with the group.</p>
    <p>Looking back on this semester I would say that I have learned more in these last dozen or so weeks than I have in a long time. It’s because I had to learn new topics on my own, implement them and then use that knowledge for the final project. For me, this model worked well. I wish that I could have used my group a little more and it’s on me for that failure. I didn’t want to bother them or felt that the preschool topics I was working with was too simple for their time. Reflecting now though I see that they would have helped with whatever I had needed help with. SO my big take away from this experience is to be a little more forward with my needs, take time to address what I need. I’m often worried that I am not doing enough for the group.</p>
    <p>In the future, I will work a little harder to help myself from the collective knowledge of the team I’m with. I will do my best to bust my hump and do as good a job I can do but also make sure to rely on the strength of those around me. It's not often that I get the opportunity to work with such talented people, so I need to learn from them. I need to find out the pattern of success they've taken and take that same path. All in all, great semester and I look forward to taking all of my new skills and to keep building on them as I work towards graduation and after.</p>
